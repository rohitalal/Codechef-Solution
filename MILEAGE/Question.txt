Problem
Chef wants to rent a car to travel to his restaurant which is N kilometers away. He can either rent a petrol car or a diesel car.
One litre of petrol costs X rupees and one litre of diesel costs Y rupees. Chef can travel A kilometers with one litre of petrol and B kilometers with one litre of diesel.
Chef can buy petrol and diesel in any amount, not necessarily integer. For example, if X=95, Chef can buy half a litre of petrol by paying 95/2 = 47.5 rupees.
Which car should the chef rent in order to minimize the cost of his travel?

DIESEL if the cost of travel is less using diesel car or 
ANY if cost of travel is same in both the cases.
